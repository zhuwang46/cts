# cts

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of cts is to fit continuous time autoregressive models with the        Kalman filter. See Wang (2013) <doi:10.18637/jss.v053.i05>.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cts from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zhuwang46/cts")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(cts)
## basic example code
data(V22174)
fit <- car(V22174,scale=0.2,order=7, ctrl=car_control(trace=FALSE))
summary(fit)
AIC(fit)
factab(fit)
```
